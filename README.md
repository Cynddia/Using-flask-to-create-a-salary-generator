# Using-flask-to-create-a-salary-generator
In this application we use the dataset from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pankeshpatel/hiring and allow a user to predict the salary of the application using flask.
There is a login application that asks for user data and checks if the user is authorizaed or not.
